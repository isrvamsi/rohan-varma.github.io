        <h1>about me</h1>

        <p>My name is Rohan Varma, and I am a second year Computer Science and Applied Mathematics student at UCLA. I grew up in sunny San Jose, California, where I ran cross country and track and field at Evergreen Valley High School. My interest in Computer Science began as a junior in high school, when I took the AP Computer Science course and went to a few programming competitions. I enjoy programming, running, reading about random things, and following politics.</p>

        <h1>about my interests</h1>

        <p>I'm currently interested in designing, implementing, and studying machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. To this end, I've studied Andrew Ng's (link this) machine learning course as well as Google's Deep Learning course (link this too). Other than that, I am a full-stack web developer for the Daily Bruin, working with Rails on the backend and Angular JS on the front-end. I am also involved with X1 robotics, contributing to the Python/Raspberry Pi subystem as part of a team that is aiming to make an autonomous quadcopter. I also am on IEEE's Corporate Relations Board, where I am responsible for maintaining industry relations and reaching out to companies to sponsor hackathons and give talks on campus.</p>

        <h1>about my projects</h1>

        <p>I've coded a few small projects as I've ventured into learning different things - whether it be sentiment analysis, gradient descent, or JavaScript development (this website). Specifics on particular projects can be found on my <a href="projects.html"> projects page</a>. My projects are open-sourced on my github, and I'm hoping to consistently add to them in the coming years. Feel free to open up an issue or submit a pull request if you find a bug or have a suggestion!</p>

        <h1>about my research</h1>

        <p>I'm currently an undergraduate researcher at UCLA's Ozcan Lab, an EE Lab that specializes in leveraging mobile technology with computational methods to rapidly image and learn from biological data. My responsibilities at the lab, under the guidance of Dr. Hatice Koydemir, include developing image processing algorithms to extract features from images of objects such as sickle cells, writing code for internal tools that automate lab tasks such as training data population and image selection, and using machine learning algorithms to train classifiers that can classify cells based on their extracted features. </p>
