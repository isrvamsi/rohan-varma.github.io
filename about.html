        <h1>about me</h1>

        <p>My name is Rohan Varma, and I am a second year Computer Science student at UCLA. I am also planning to minor in Mathematics. I grew up in sunny San Jose, California, where I ran cross country and track and field at Evergreen Valley High School. My interest in Computer Science began as a junior in high school, when I took the AP Computer Science course and went to a few programming competitions. I enjoy programming, running, reading about random things, and following politics.</p>

        <h1>about my interests</h1>

        <p>I'm currently interested in designing, implementing, and studying machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. I remember my first exposure to machine learning as a senior in high school, when, by fortune, I came across a series of machine learning lectures by a professor from Caltech on youtube. I watched the first few lectures where he gave a mathematically rigorous introduction to machine learning, contextualizing the concepts through the example of making accurate predictions of movies that users would like. Although most of the material went over my head, I was nonetheless captivated. Since then, I've spent time learning about machine learning through Andrew Ng's and Google's courses, and done a few machine learning projects. I'm currently learning about neural networks and hope to apply them to an image-searching project I'm working on.  </p>

        <h1>about my projects</h1>

        <p>I've coded a few small projects as I've ventured into learning different things - whether it be sentiment analysis, gradient descent, or JavaScript development (this website). Specifics on particular projects can be found on my <a href="projects.html"> projects page</a>. My projects are open-sourced on my github, and I'm hoping to consistently add to them in the coming years. Feel free to open up an issue or submit a pull request if you find a bug or have a suggestion!</p>

        <h1>about my research</h1>

        <p>I'm currently an undergraduate researcher at UCLA's Ozcan Lab, an EE Lab that specializes in leveraging mobile technology with computational methods to rapidly image and learn from biological data. My responsibilities at the lab, under the guidance of Dr. Hatice Koydemir, include developing image processing algorithms to extract features from images of objects such as sickle cells, writing code for internal tools that automate lab tasks such as training data population and image selection, and using machine learning algorithms to train classifiers that can classify cells based on their extracted features. </p>
